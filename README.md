This repo was just a POC and was hacked up in few weeks. This is no longer maintained and the project has a new home. You can find it here:
[anymock-app](https://github.com/sohaibalam67/anymock-app)

The code in this repo is garbage, literally. But hey! everything has a tradeoff.

Here is link if you want to try it. Use Chrome or Safari. There are lots of bugs and perf issues for Firefox which I'm planning to fix while migrating.

[Here](sohaibalam67/mockup-experiment) is me, experimenting before building it.
