This repo was just a POC and was hacked together in few weeks. This is no longer maintained and the project has a new home. You can find it here:
[anymock-app](https://github.com/sohaibalam67/anymock-app)

The code in this repo is garbage, literally. But hey! everything has a tradeoff.

Here is link if you want to try it. Use Chrome. There are lots of bugs and perf issues for Firefox and Safari which I'm planning to fix while migrating.

[Here](https://github.com/sohaibalam67/mockup-experiment) is me, experimenting before building it.

### Dribbble shot
Add multiple devices on the same canvas to create a nice dribbble shot. Templates support is not available yet, but when it ships, creating a dribbble shot would be trivially easy. For now, you'll have to arrange devices on canvas on your own.

### 250+ device frames
A lot of devices are available, almost more than 250 frames across desktops, laptops, tablets, phones, watches, and browsers. You can also use any google fonts with it. That's a lot of fonts!!!

### Beautify your background
Add color or image to the canvas background. Unsplash integration coming soon, you'll be able to add background images directly from unsplash. Transparent background is supported too, so go ahead, create assets for your webpage with device frames and no background.

### Canvas Alignment lines
Aligning objects to canvas is super easy, whenever you want to place objects to the center of the canvas, it snaps and fits in, so you don't have to worry about pushing every pixel.

### Object Alignment lines
Aligning objects to other objects on the canvas is super easy too. Align objects by edges or center.

### Hotkeys
All the major hotkeys are supported, with more hotkeys being added as the app develops.

Here is what you should be able to do when the app is finished with basic features.
